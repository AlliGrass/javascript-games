# JavaScript Games
A collection of well known and beloved games that run on JavaScript. Here they can be easily accessed and played. Currently the planned list include:
- Solitaire
- Mastermind (Developed)
- Minefield (?)
- Battleships (?) <!-- mining -->

## Tech Stack

## Overview
### Purpose: Centralise Game Projects
I had previously made Solitaire within 3 days and after revisiting the project decided I wished to refurbish the application. In doing so I found the inspiration to build several other games. Rather than separate the applications I thought it would be more beneficial to group them together.

### Current Status: Development
Currently I am working on other projects that have my priority and have made this repository to track where this project will be on my profile. I have only developed the mechanics to mastermind, however the ui is still undeveloped.
